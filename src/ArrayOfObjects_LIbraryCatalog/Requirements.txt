Library Catalog System
Develop a Java program that allows a library to manage its catalog of books. Users can add new books to the catalog, search for books by title, and list all books in the catalog.
Book class Requirements:
• Attributes:
• title: String to store the title of the book.
• author: String to store the author's name.
• yearPublished: int to store the year the book was published.
• Constructor:
• Book(String title, String author, int yearPublished): Initializes a new Book object with the provided title, author, and publication year.
• Getters/Setters:
• Implement getters for all three attributes. Setters are optional based on whether you want book details to be mutable.
LibraryCatalog class Requirements:
• Attributes:
• books: An array of Book objects to store the catalog.
• count: An int to track the number of books currently in the catalog.
• Constructor:
• LibraryCatalog(int size): Initializes the catalog with a specific size for the books array and sets count to 0.
• Methods:
• addBook(Book book): Adds a new Book to the books array and increments count.
• searchByTitle(String title): Searches for books by title. Prints details of all books that match the search query.
• displayCatalog(): Prints details of all books in the catalog.
Main Method Requirements:
• Initialize a Scanner object to read input from the console.
• Create a LibraryCatalog object.
• Enter a loop that allows the user to choose actions like adding a book, searching by title, listing all books, or exiting.
• Based on user input, perform the corresponding actions using the methods of LibraryCatalog.
