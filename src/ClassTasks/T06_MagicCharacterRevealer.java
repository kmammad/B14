/**
 Magic Character Revealer

 Create a Java program that generates a random character and performs some mathematical operations on it.

 Task Description:

 1. Generate a Random Character:

 Use the Math.random() method to generate a random uppercase letter character.

 2. Perform Mathematical Operations:

 Use the Math class methods to perform the following operations on the ASCII value of the generated character:
 - square root of its ASCII value
 - transform the character by adding 5
 - transform the character by raising the ASCII value to the power of 4

 3. Display Results:

 Display the original character, the ASCII value, and the results of the mathematical operations.


 EXAMPLE:

 Randomly Generated Uppercase Character: C
 ASCII Value: 67
 Square Root of ASCII Value: 8.18535277187245
 Character transformed by adding 5: H
 Character transformed by raising to the 4th power:ç­‘
